==bugs / fixes==
    * [X] Textytest sometimes the character appears rotated?
        * It had to do with initialization of square. I did not
         initialize rotation, so if the memory was not 0 previously,
         it rotated to a random angle.
    * [ ] separate completely sdl layer from game code
        * [ ] sdl_swapbuffers
        * [ ] platform callbacks...
    None so far

                * B: Complain
        * a render_text function
            * Takes a text struct perhaps some other info?
